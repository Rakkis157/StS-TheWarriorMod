# The Warrior
The Warrior is a new mod that adds a custom character called The Warrior. The main idea of this mod is COMBO.

This mod is currently BETA. It already added 75 cards and 1 starting relic, but they need some art and need to be balanced. Any advice will be welcome. If you found a bug, please open a new issue to let me know.

There's a OUTDATED wiki page for this mod:
https://github.com/yhrcyt/StS-TheWarriorMod/wiki

I want to improve this mod, and make it more balanced. Any card idea? How do you think of those cards? They're indeed unbalanced, so How can I balance them? Please let me know! If you have any idea, or just ANYTHING IN YOUR MIND, feel free to open a new issue. Otherwise, I don't know how to update the mod!

__*This mod is most likely going to be deprecated soon if there's no good idea that can save the mod.*__
